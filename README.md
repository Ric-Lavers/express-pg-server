# API Document

## Purpose

Produce a API that allows for the functionality of a new portfolio site.
But what will this new iteration of the site actually do!, the old iteration was purely front-end with a quick skill set description and links out to linked in etc.
This one may need a little more, including;
- a blog.
- a Stripe pay me.
- a new version of the SVG string art generator.
- demonstration of work.
    - sortable tables.
    - form with preview
    - search animation
_so theres a lot fo work there_
